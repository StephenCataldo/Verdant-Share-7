Please follow these instructions, just enabling the module
will not work smoothly.

I. BASIC INSTALLATION

[-1] Efforts to fix that need to be tested on next install:

* PHP filter not required.  Something goofy about .info? I cleaned it up a bit.
* GMap is unable to save the marker bundle. Markers will not work!

[0] Enable the verdant_share module
==> expect error message (we haven't got features to handle this yet): 
    GMap is unable to save the marker bundle. Markers will not work!

==> Note: currently, this module requires the php text format.

[1A] Taxonomy, Sorry.
  Taxonomy terms aren't importing.  User taxonomy_csv to import this
  (cut and paste) (set to full terms or full term definitions and links)
  Semi-colon delimited!!!
  Import into Means of Transit vocabulary !!!

[1C] Problem with views module for contact, need to be patched....
got to views directory
wget drupal.org/files/issues/views_contact_link-1021590-54.patch
patch -p1 < views_contact_link-1021590-54.patch

[2] Maps and Locations

  A. Gmaps.    admin/config/services/gmap
    - get a Google Maps API Key
    - You'll probably want to center the map on your event, 
      and zoom in based on how far average people are driving. 

  B. Location.   admin/config/content/location 
    - Required: Use a Google Map to set latitude and longitude  


  C. GMap markers:  
     - enable gmap markers at admin/structure/taxonomy/means_of_transit/edit 
        (proof-readers: did this work out of the box?)
	 - Then set the marker for each taxonomy to match the view
       (you can of course fiddle with both the view's images ...
       we'd love a better set of graphics!)  
        red = need ride, orange = either, yellow = offer
        green = bus/bicycle
     - Also edit the view for the map page to change the keys to your 
       local server.  ** We should move this to code one day  
       ** Also requires php.  ** Drafted, may be working.  If you want
       different graphics of course have to edit the urls.

alternative text:

	@help = have you seen another module that creates a taxonomy?
	-->Haven't seen another module, but here's a good guide to creating
	vocabularies and terms programmatically: 
	http://steindom.com/articles/creating-vocabularies-and-taxonomy-terms-programmatically-drupal-7

try...  Combine that with simple gmap_taxonomy_term
tid, marker
1 	small orange
2 	small red
3 	small yellow
4 	small green	


	bus = small dark green, 
	offer = small yellow
	either = small organge
	need ride = small bright red
	@todo: Ideally, someone will great new images.
	@note: go back to admin/settings/gmap and Regenerate marker cache, if needed
	@note: that still didn't do it, not sure why
    @note: the above two notes didn't happen to me, erase if they don't
        affect you, maybe this is fixed.


[3] Blocks: The view will create a chart and map for people to share rides.
  Posts are created on those pages using a block. admin/structure/block
  Go to the blocks page and move "Ride Share Profile Block" 
    to an appropriate region(eg, Left Sidebar, moved to the top of the region).
  ( Option: I tend to ignore the Exposed Form blocks, but they may be interesting to
  play with, especially if you'd like to make major changes.)

[4] Review permissions, for whatever role you want using the carpool system:
  A. Submit latitude/longitude
     ** Feedback: we're making you do this by hand because it seems invasive
     to change it for you, which could be done in the feature export.
  B. Share Ride:  Create, Edit and Delete your own content


[5] Account Settings: admin/config/people/accounts
  A. Contact: recommended to set contact form default to enabled by default
     think about users who may have
     signed up already (including your admin account) if you had a different
     default
     @ToDo: how do we deal with users who don't want to be contacted?
  B. Recommended, enable user pictures


OPTIONS and INFORMATION ON CODER APPROACH

Verdant_Share uses a lot of standard components (cck, flags, views) that you're
welcome to mess with -- please post your story of how you use this module:

* You can replace the text "Please sign in to create a rideshare post"
  with a login block.  
  Notes are already in the code! (grep the quote)
  @ToDo -- we could make this configurable.

* Giving node's locations, and setting them as cck fields, are options
that are supposed to conflict.  In May, 2011, I'm setting locations for the
whole node... if you've enabled the cck-location module [     ] 
you'll have to hope someone has fixed the conflict, or change the way
the view and cck work here.  This note is from D6... but if you explore
Location as a CCK field please report back!



* Something uses "A PHP code input format has been created."  This
didn't create any prolems with my setup, let me know if it does for you!


Other Options: you can edit the Content Type to collect different details
on the address or change the default country.  Locative information at /admin/structure/types/manage/share-ride

Exposed Filters
The view that comes with this module uses pre-digested one-click views, like
"show me everyone arriving within two hour of my arrival."  The exposed filters
are put in a block that we normally wouldn't display to users, but of course
you can, or use it to re-write our suggested exposed-filter-links.

Menus: The chart and map are placed in your menu by the view.  We could
explore making the URLs configurable




[7] Content Type: Locations aren't being exported/imported correctly,
so set the minimum number of locations to 1.  ( @todo: can I import this info, hand
coding, even if the export skips it?) 

Being fixed... Automatic title wasn't part of the cck export 
(haven't even looked at this issue yet).  ** may have fixed this. the fix
seems clunkier than this recommendation **  ** BEING FIXED **
Go to the share-ride content type, and
enable "Automatic title generation."  Set it to 
"Automatically generate the title
and hide the title field," using this pattern (or whatever you like):
[author-name]'s rideshare


[10] Optional, put the conference on the map.  Haven't thought about this yet...

* Content Taxonomy didn't quite come through.  Why?  Is it about the order 
things are enabled?  Trying new things with each round.  It works if I put the
code in the enable section instead of install.
