Please follow these instructions, just enabling the module
will not work smoothly.

[0] Features insufficient:

    * GMap markers: enable gmap markers at
		  admin/structure/taxonomy/means_of_transit/edit
    * Then set the marker for each taxonomy to match the view
      (you can of course fiddle with both the view's images ...
       we'd love a better set of graphics!)
    * Also edit the view for the map page to change the keys to your 
      local server.  ** We should move this to code one day  
      ** Also requires php.



OPTIONS and INFORMATION ON CODER APPROACH

Verdant_Share uses a lot of standard components (cck, flags, views) that you're
welcome to mess with -- please post your story of how you use this module:


You can replace the text "Please sign in to create a rideshare post"
  with a login block.  @ToDo -- we could make this configurable

[0] Giving node's locations, and setting them as cck fields, are options
that are supposed to conflict.  In May, 2011, I'm setting locations for the
whole node... if you've enabled the cck-location module [     ] 
you'll have to hope someone has fixed the conflict, or change the way
the view and cck work here.

[1] jQuery UI is required, and can be difficult to set up -- please enable
before attempting to enable verdant_share.

If it's not already enabled (used here for date popups, work around
should be easy if you don't use it at all, but the import process gets
messed up if jQuery UI isn't enable-able), I seemed to need to 
enable jQuery Update *first*, then follow the other instructions in jQuery UI,
or whatever it takes, and don't attempt to enable Verdant Share until
jQuery UI is running.
( @todo: find great how-to notes and link to them, or remove dependency )

[2] Once jQuery UI is enabled, make sure the other modules are present,
and when you enable Verdant_Share, the rest should be enabled automatically.

* Something uses "A PHP code input format has been created."  This
didn't create any prolems with my setup, let me know if it does for you!


[3] Maps: gmap module needs to be running (you can get it running later), which 
involves getting a Google Maps API Key. See admin/config/services/gmap
You'll probably want to center the map on your event, and zoom
in based on how far average people are driving. 

Required:
Use a Goole Map to set latitude and longitude 
 at admin/config/content/location

Other Options: you can edit the Content Type to collect different details
on the address or change the default country.  Locative information at /admin/structure/types/manage/share-ride

Exposed Filters
The view that comes with this module uses pre-digested one-click views, like
"show me everyone arriving within two hour of my arrival."  The exposed filters
are put in a block that we normally wouldn't display to users, but of course
you can, or use it to re-write our suggested exposed-filter-links.

[4] Blocks: The view will create a chart and map for people to share rides.
People's posts are created using content_profile, shown in a block
on the pages with the chart or map.  Go to the blocks page
and move "Ride Share Profile Block" to an appropriate region (eg, Left Sidebar).
I tend to ignore the Exposed Form blocks, but they may be interesting to
play with, especially if you'd like to make major changes.

[5] Menus: The chart and map are placed in your menu (as I write this, as tabs,
but I may fiddle with that faster than I document).  
Move them, tab or un-tab them, display just one or the other as preferred.

[6] GMAP markers must be enabled by hand (for now).  Go to the vocubulary page
for "Means of Transit" and enable "GMap markers."  Then go to each term
and give them an image.  
	@help = have you seen another module that creates a taxonomy?
	-->Haven't seen another module, but here's a good guide to creating
	vocabularies and terms programmatically: 
	http://steindom.com/articles/creating-vocabularies-and-taxonomy-terms-programmatically-drupal-7
	
	bus = small dark green, 
	offer = small yellow
	either = small organge
	need ride = small bright red
	@todo: Ideally, someone will great new images.
	@note: go back to admin/settings/gmap and Regenerate marker cache, if needed
	@note: that still didn't do it, not sure why

[g] Go to settings for location and click on "Use a Google Map to set latitude and longitude" if you haven't already.

[g2] Go to permissions ( admin/user/permissions ), and set location module:
submit latitude/longitude ok for authenticated users

[7] Content Type: Locations aren't being exported/imported correctly,
so set the minimum number of locations to 1.  ( @todo: can I import this info, hand
coding, even if the export skips it?) 

Being fixed... Automatic title wasn't part of the cck export 
(haven't even looked at this issue yet).  ** may have fixed this. the fix
seems clunkier than this recommendation **  ** BEING FIXED **
Go to the share-ride content type, and
enable "Automatic title generation."  Set it to 
"Automatically generate the title
and hide the title field," using this pattern (or whatever you like):
[author-name]'s rideshare

[8] Contact: recommended to set contract form default to enabled by default
at admin/build/contact/settings, and think about users who may have
signed up already (including your admin account).

[9] Recommended, enable user pictures at admin/user/settings

[10] Optional, put the conference on the map.  Haven't thought about this yet...

* Content Taxonomy didn't quite come through.  Why?  Is it about the order 
things are enabled?  Trying new things with each round.  It works if I put the
code in the enable section instead of install.
